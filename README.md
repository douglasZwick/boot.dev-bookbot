# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project! I made it a little tiny bit cooler than what the course required of me.

# Usage

Install Python 3 if you haven't already. Then just run `python3 main.py <textpath>`, replacing `<textpath>` with a local path to a text file. There are some additional options you can use if you like, so try `python3 main.py --help` to see what it can do.
